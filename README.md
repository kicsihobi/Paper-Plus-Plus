This is my fork of [Paper-Plus-Plus (jsonresume-theme-paper-plus-plus)](https://github.com/lindell/Paper-Plus-Plus)

I customized it a bit to fit my need, may even broke the full JSON resume compliance of it, but most certainly extended it with some bits and bobs.

Below is the original readme:
# [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/) Paper++ theme

This is a theme for [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/). It's a fork of [jsonresume-theme-paper](https://github.com/TimDaub/jsonresume-theme-paper) but with smaller support for proper **responsive design** for the web and smaller visual changes.
